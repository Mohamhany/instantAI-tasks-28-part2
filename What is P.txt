What is P-value
The p-value, also known as the probability value, is a statistical measure used to determine the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis in hypothesis testing. It quantifies the likelihood of observing the data or more extreme data if the null hypothesis were true. In simpler terms, the p-value indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results, or results more extreme, assuming that there is no true effect or relationship in the population.
Here's how the p-value is typically interpreted:
* If the p-value is small (typically less than a predetermined significance level, often 0.05), it suggests that the observed data is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone if the null hypothesis were true. In this case, the evidence is considered statistically significant, and the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis.
* If the p-value is large (greater than the significance level), it suggests that the observed data is reasonably likely to have occurred by chance alone if the null hypothesis were true. In this case, the evidence is not statistically significant, and there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
It's important to note that the p-value does not provide information about the magnitude or practical significance of an effect or relationship. It only indicates the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis based on the observed data.
Additionally, it's crucial to interpret the p-value in the context of the specific hypothesis being tested, the study design, and any relevant assumptions. The interpretation of p-values should not be the sole basis for drawing conclusions, and other factors such as effect size, sample size, and study design should also be considered.
