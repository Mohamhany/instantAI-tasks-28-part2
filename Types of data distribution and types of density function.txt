 Types of data distribution and types of density function
Here are some types of data distributions and their associated density functions, described without using formulas:
1. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):
* Characteristics: The normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. It is often used to model naturally occurring phenomena where the data clusters around a central value, with the majority of observations falling within one standard deviation of the mean.
2. Uniform Distribution:
* Characteristics: The uniform distribution has a constant probability density over a defined range. It is often used when all values within a given interval are equally likely to occur.
3. Exponential Distribution:
* Characteristics: The exponential distribution is typically used to model the time between events in a Poisson process. It is characterized by a decreasing rate of occurrence over time.
4. Poisson Distribution:
* Characteristics: The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of events occurring within a fixed time period when the events occur independently at a constant average rate.
5. Binomial Distribution:
* Characteristics: The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. It is characterized by discrete outcomes and two parameters: the number of trials and the probability of success in each trial.
6. Gamma Distribution:
* Characteristics: The gamma distribution is commonly used to model continuous positive variables. It is often employed in reliability analysis and queuing theory.
7. Log-Normal Distribution:
* Characteristics: The log-normal distribution is a skewed distribution that arises when the logarithm of a variable follows a normal distribution. It is often used to model variables that are inherently positive and have a positively skewed distribution.
8. Weibull Distribution:
* Characteristics: The Weibull distribution is often used to model the time it takes for an event to occur. It can describe distributions that are either positively skewed, negatively skewed, or symmetric, depending on its parameters.
9. Beta Distribution:
* Characteristics: The beta distribution is a versatile distribution that can take on various shapes, including symmetric, U-shaped, J-shaped, and skewed. It is often used to model random variables that are bounded between 0 and 1, such as probabilities.
